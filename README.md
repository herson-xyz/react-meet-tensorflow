## Description
This project is an experiment to test the use of [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in a project. For face-detection, I'm using a [pre-trained TensorFlow model via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/face-detection).
